# WeChat Mini Program

## WebView, JS-SDK and Mini Program

WeChat has built-in WebView to preview and interact with web content without leaving the messaging app. So any existing web application can be used in WeChat. It is not special. Most messaging mobile applications provide WebView so users can preview external content faster and stay in the application longer.

WeChat added extra API to the WebView, so web application can use WeChat features through JavaScript, like get username and friends, share photos in Friendâ€™s circle. These APIs then become WeChat JS-SDK. An application with WeChat JS-SDK support can make advantages of WeChat, providing smoother experience. Integration of WeChat JS-SDK is easy and fast. Any existing web applications can become a WeChat web app, even it is a static web page or a WordPress site. It is not necessary to create a dedicated WeChat web app.

The pain point of mobile web application is still loading speed and transition smoothness. So WeChat made a new front-end technology stack: Mini Program. It is light weight, platform independent, uses JavaScript, like web applications. It is lightning fast and smooth, like native application.
